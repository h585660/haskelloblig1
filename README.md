# 🚀 Haskell Spreadsheet Evaluator: Oblig1 🚀

Hello, Haskell enthusiasts and curious coders! Welcome to my Haskell journey's "final boss" before the big exam: the Oblig1 project! It's a little rough around the edges, but hey, it's been a fun ride! 🎢

## 🌟 About The Project

This project is all about creating a Haskell-based spreadsheet evaluator. Think of it as Excel, but with more `>>=` and less GUI. It's my own little adventure in functional programming, complete with all the twists and turns! Here's a sneak peek of what's inside:

- **🔢 Expression Evaluation:** Crunching numbers with references, constants, sums, additions, and multiplications.
- **📐 Cell Range Support:** Handling those pesky cell ranges with grace.
- **📝 Sheet Representation:** A neat way to keep track of all those cells and their myriad expressions.
- **🔍 Custom Parser:** Because who doesn't love parsing text files into meaningful data?

## 🚀 How It Works

Here's the deal: this program eats a custom spreadsheet format for breakfast and then evaluates all the expressions in it for lunch. 

- **Arithmetic operations?** Easy peasy. 🍋
- **Cell references?** Piece of cake. 🍰
- **Summing up ranges?** Just like a walk in the park. 🌳

And voilà! You're now a Haskell spreadsheet wizard! 🧙‍♂️

## 🛠 Installation and Running the Program

Before you begin, make sure you have GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) ready to go. Once you're all set:

```bash
ghc Oblig1.hs -o Oblig1
./Oblig1
